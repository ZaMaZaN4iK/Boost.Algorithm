# This is the proposed Boost.Algorithm library

It will be reviewed by the [Boost](<http://www.boost.org>) community from September 22nd through October 1st, 2011. It is licensed under the [Boost Software License, Version 1.0](http://www.boost.org/LICENSE_1_0.txt)

The Boost.Algorithms library is a work in progress; it is not meant to be a complete set of general purpose algorithms for C++ programming; but rather a small collection of useful algorithms, and a structure for adding more over time.

The algorithms here fall into three basic categories:

1. Searching
	* Boyer-Moore Search
	* Boyer-Moore-Horspool Search
	* Knuth-Morris-Pratt search
1. Sequence properties
	* Tests to see if a sequence is ordered
	* Tests for the elements of a sequence
1. Miscellaneous
	* Constrain a value between two 'boundaries' (minmax)
